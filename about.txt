About this game:

Wolf Adventure was made in 2021.

What a funny sight it is to see a brood of ducklings with a hen!

-Listen to the story of Jemima Puddle-duck, who was annoyed because the farmer's
wife would not let her hatch her own eggs.

Her sister-in-law, Mrs. Rebeccah Puddle-duck, was perfectly willing to leave the
hatching to some one else --"I have not the patience to sit on a nest for twenty-
eight days; and no more have you, Jemima.  You would let them go cold; you know
you would!"

"I wish to hatch my own eggs; I will hatch them all by myself," quacked Jemima
Puddle-duck.

She tried to hide her eggs; but they were always found and carried off.

Jemima Puddle-duck became quite desperate.  She determined to make a nest right
away from the farm.
